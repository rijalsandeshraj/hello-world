The First Step into Programming

Hello everyone!

My name is Sandesh Rijal. I am a 'Python and Django Programmer' and I have a great love for programming.

I feel very glad to say that, with my skill-set and competencies I consider myself good enough for any given projects and tasks, and I am confident that I can deliver the best of my efforts, ultimately keeping disappointment at bay.

Previously, I had worked in the famous payment app company, called Sparrow Pay Pvt. Ltd. which owns the popular web and mobile application known as Khalti. From there, I got to know different technical know-how as I was working there as a CSR and during the time of my employment, I started learning Python in a famous IT institute ‘Broadway Infosys Nepal’ located at New Baneshwor, Kathmandu. I pretty much know all the basics of Python programming and also that of its popular framework Django. Along the time, I found myself distracted enough, so I left my job in order to focus particularly on programming. Programming and computer science have always been fascinating to me. I can devote my whole life to programming and building creative things, but due to some unexpected circumstances, I was deprived of pursuing my education in computer science. That’s a different story though.

Please contact me if you want me to work on Python projects. My email address is rijalsandeshraj@gmail.com.

Thank you!
